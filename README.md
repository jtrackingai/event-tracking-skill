# Event Tracking Skill

`event-tracking-skill` is a local-first skill and CLI for planning, generating, validating, and syncing GA4 event tracking in Google Tag Manager.

It keeps the implementation reviewable from crawl to publish:

1. analyze a site
2. group pages by business intent
3. prepare schema context
4. review the event schema
5. generate GTM config
6. sync to a GTM workspace
7. verify in Preview Mode or the Shopify manual flow
8. publish with more confidence

## What You Get

For a given website, this skill can help you:

- analyze page structure, shared UI, platform signals, and existing `dataLayer` usage
- organize pages into business-purpose groups before defining events
- generate a reviewable GA4 event schema and stakeholder-friendly event spec
- turn the approved schema into GTM-ready tags, triggers, and variables
- sync to GTM, verify before publish, and keep the whole flow artifact-driven
- support both generic websites and Shopify storefronts with different verification paths

## Installation

Recommended repo-local setup:

```bash
./setup
```

That installs dependencies, builds the CLI, and runs a basic environment check.

### Install with skills.sh (Recommended)

Use this if you want to install the skill into your local agent skills directory and start using it right away.

```bash
npx skills add jtrackingai/event-tracking-skill
```

### Manual Installation / Local Development

Use this if you want to inspect the source, run the CLI directly, or work on the skill locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtrackingai/event-tracking-skill.git
cd event-tracking-skill
npm ci
npm run build
```

`npm ci` also installs Playwright's Chromium browser, which is required by the crawl and preview steps.

After setup, use the checked-in wrapper from the repo root:

```bash
./event-tracking --help
```

If the package is installed or linked as a binary, the public command name is `event-tracking`.

`dist/cli.js` is an internal implementation path, not the documented command surface.

## Documentation Map

- [README.md](README.md) for installation, quick start, and the public command surface
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for artifact lifecycle, branch behavior, and system boundaries
- [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for maintainer commands, edit rules, and release checks
- [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md) for Codex-oriented install, update, and troubleshooting notes
- [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for the umbrella skill and phase-skill map
- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the agent-facing workflow contract

## Skill Family

The repository now has:

- one umbrella skill: `event-tracking-skill`
- six phase-oriented subskills under `skills/`

Use the umbrella skill for end-to-end or ambiguous requests. Use the phase skills when the user clearly wants only one part of the workflow, such as discovery, grouping, schema review, GTM sync, preview QA, or Shopify-specific handling.

See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for the full map.

Root skill UI metadata now lives in [agents/openai.yaml](agents/openai.yaml).

## Exported Skill Bundles

If you need to package these skills outside this repository, generate self-contained bundles with:

```bash
npm run export:skills
```

That writes per-skill bundles to `dist/skill-bundles/<skill-name>/`.

Each exported bundle includes:

- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/openai.yaml`
- the `references/` files that the skill may need, including exported `architecture.md` and `skill-map.md` where relevant

The exported bundles rewrite command examples to the public `event-tracking` command name. Inside this repository, keep using `./event-tracking`.

## Install Into Codex

To install the exported bundles into the default Codex skills directory, run:

```bash
npm run install:skills
```

For a development-friendly install that updates in place as `dist/skill-bundles/` changes, use link mode:

```bash
npm run install:skills -- --mode link
```

Default target resolution:

- `$CODEX_HOME/skills` when `CODEX_HOME` is set
- otherwise `~/.codex/skills`

Useful variants:

```bash
npm run install:skills -- --target-dir /tmp/codex-skills
npm run install:skills -- --mode link --target-dir ~/.codex/skills
npm run install:skills -- --skill event-tracking-skill --skill tracking-schema
./setup --install-skills
./setup --install-skills --mode link
```

The installer can either copy or link the exported bundles into the target directory, so rerun the export or install step after skill text or metadata changes.

Use [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md) for a Codex-specific install/update workflow, including the new link mode and optional `.codex/INSTALL.md` bootstrap path.

## Quick Start

### Use It As A Skill

If you are using this in an agent environment, call it in natural language and provide the current workflow inputs:

```text
Use event-tracking-skill to set up GA4 / GTM tracking for https://www.example.com.
Use ./output as the output root directory.
GA4 Measurement ID is G-XXXXXXXXXX.
Google tag ID is GT-XXXXXXX if needed.
```

The skill creates the run artifact directory as `<output-root>/<url-slug>` and then walks through grouping, schema review, GTM generation, sync, preview, and publish.

### Use It As A CLI

Start with site analysis:

```bash
./event-tracking analyze https://www.example.com --output-root ./output
```

The CLI creates the artifact directory automatically as `<output-root>/<url-slug>`, for example `./output/example_com`.

After filling `pageGroups` in `./output/example_com/site-analysis.json`, continue with the same artifact directory:

```bash
./event-tracking confirm-page-groups ./output/example_com/site-analysis.json
./event-tracking prepare-schema ./output/example_com/site-analysis.json
./event-tracking validate-schema ./output/example_com/event-schema.json --check-selectors
./event-tracking generate-spec ./output/example_com/event-schema.json
./event-tracking confirm-schema ./output/example_com/event-schema.json
./event-tracking generate-gtm ./output/example_com/event-schema.json --measurement-id G-XXXXXXXXXX
./event-tracking sync ./output/example_com/gtm-config.json
./event-tracking preview ./output/example_com/event-schema.json --context-file ./output/example_com/gtm-context.json
./event-tracking publish --context-file ./output/example_com/gtm-context.json --version-name "GA4 Events v1"
```

Important workflow note:

- `prepare-schema` requires `pageGroups` to already be filled in `site-analysis.json` and explicitly confirmed
- after grouping pages, run `./event-tracking confirm-page-groups <artifact-dir>/site-analysis.json`
- for generic sites, `event-schema.json` is authored after `prepare-schema` from `schema-context.json`
- for Shopify sites, `prepare-schema` bootstraps `event-schema.json` automatically if it does not already exist

The full workflow used by the skill is documented in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## Common Entry Points

You do not need to run the full flow every time.

| Intent | Start From | Minimum Inputs | Typical Command(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inspect current progress | Any artifact directory or file inside it | artifact directory or file path | `./event-tracking status <artifact-dir>` |
| Analyze a new site | Step 1 | URL, output root | `./event-tracking analyze <url> --output-root <dir>` |
| Review or approve page groups | Step 2 | `site-analysis.json` | update `pageGroups`, then `./event-tracking confirm-page-groups <artifact-dir>/site-analysis.json` |
| Author or review schema | Step 3 | confirmed `site-analysis.json` | `prepare-schema`, edit `event-schema.json`, `validate-schema`, `generate-spec`, `confirm-schema` |
| Generate GTM config from an approved schema | Step 4 | `event-schema.json`, measurement ID | `./event-tracking generate-gtm <artifact-dir>/event-schema.json --measurement-id <id>` |
| Sync an approved GTM config | Step 5 | `gtm-config.json` | `./event-tracking sync <artifact-dir>/gtm-config.json` |
| QA an existing GTM workspace | Step 6 | `event-schema.json`, `gtm-context.json` | `./event-tracking preview <artifact-dir>/event-schema.json --context-file <artifact-dir>/gtm-context.json` |
| Publish an already-verified workspace | Step 7 | `gtm-context.json` | `./event-tracking publish --context-file <artifact-dir>/gtm-context.json --version-name "GA4 Events v1"` |

If a user already has an artifact directory, resume from the earliest unmet prerequisite instead of restarting from `analyze`.

## Required Inputs

Before running the full workflow, prepare:

- target website URL
- output root directory for generated artifacts
- GA4 Measurement ID
- optional Google tag ID

The artifact directory is required for every downstream step and is derived as `<output-root>/<url-slug>`.

## Workflow

The current workflow mixes agent-led review steps with CLI execution steps.

| Step | Owner | What It Does | Command / Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Analyze | CLI | Crawls the site and captures pages, shared UI, warnings, detected events, and platform signals | `./event-tracking analyze <url> --output-root <output-root>` -> `site-analysis.json` |
| Page Grouping | Agent or user | Fills `pageGroups` in `site-analysis.json` by business purpose before schema preparation | updated `site-analysis.json` |
| Page Group Confirmation | User + CLI | Reviews the current page groups and records explicit approval for the current `pageGroups` snapshot | `./event-tracking confirm-page-groups <artifact-dir>/site-analysis.json` -> updated `site-analysis.json` |
| Prepare Schema Context | CLI | Compresses grouped analysis for schema authoring and bootstraps Shopify artifacts when needed | `./event-tracking prepare-schema <artifact-dir>/site-analysis.json` -> `schema-context.json`, Shopify bootstrap files |
| Schema Authoring And Review | Agent or user + CLI validation | Creates or refines `event-schema.json`, validates selectors, generates a readable spec, and records schema approval | `validate-schema`, `generate-spec`, `confirm-schema` -> `event-schema.json`, `event-spec.md`, `workflow-state.json` |
| GTM Generation | CLI | Converts the approved schema into GTM-ready tags, triggers, and variables | `./event-tracking generate-gtm <artifact-dir>/event-schema.json --measurement-id <G-XXXXXXXXXX>` -> `gtm-config.json` |
| GTM Sync | CLI | Authenticates with Google, requires explicit account/container/workspace selection, and syncs the generated configuration | `./event-tracking sync <artifact-dir>/gtm-config.json` -> `gtm-context.json`, `credentials.json` |
| Verification | CLI | Runs GTM preview for generic sites, or writes a Shopify manual verification guide instead | `./event-tracking preview <artifact-dir>/event-schema.json --context-file <artifact-dir>/gtm-context.json` -> `preview-report.md`, `preview-result.json` |
| Publish | CLI | Publishes the validated GTM workspace as a new container version | `./event-tracking publish --context-file <artifact-dir>/gtm-context.json --version-name "GA4 Events v1"` |

## Generic vs Shopify Branch

After `analyze`, the workflow splits into two branches:

- `generic`: follow the standard page grouping, schema authoring, GTM sync, and automated preview flow
- `shopify`: keep the same crawl and grouping steps, but use Shopify bootstrap artifacts, generate a Shopify custom pixel after `sync`, and use manual post-install verification instead of the normal automated browser preview

Shopify-specific behavior today:

- `prepare-schema` writes `shopify-schema-template.json` and `shopify-bootstrap-review.md`
- `prepare-schema` initializes `event-schema.json` automatically when it does not exist yet
- `sync` generates `shopify-custom-pixel.js` and `shopify-install.md`
- `preview` skips automated browser validation and writes manual Shopify verification guidance instead

For the detailed Shopify branch, see [references/shopify-workflow.md](references/shopify-workflow.md).

## Main Artifacts

All generated files live inside one artifact directory for the run.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `site-analysis.json` | Crawl output with pages, platform signals, and page groups |
| `schema-context.json` | Compressed context used for event schema authoring |
| `event-schema.json` | Primary editable tracking schema before GTM generation |
| `event-spec.md` | Human-readable event spec for stakeholder review |
| `workflow-state.json` | Machine-readable workflow checkpoint state, including schema approval, verification status, and next recommended step |
| `gtm-config.json` | GTM Web Container export plus tracking metadata |
| `gtm-context.json` | Saved GTM account, container, and workspace IDs |
| `credentials.json` | Local Google OAuth token cache for this artifact directory |
| `preview-report.md` | Human-readable verification report |
| `preview-result.json` | Raw preview verification data |
| `shopify-schema-template.json` | Shopify-only bootstrap schema template |
| `shopify-bootstrap-review.md` | Shopify-only bootstrap review summary |
| `shopify-custom-pixel.js` | Shopify-only custom pixel artifact generated after `sync` |
| `shopify-install.md` | Shopify-only install guide for the generated custom pixel |

For the full output contract, see [references/output-contract.md](references/output-contract.md).

## GTM Selection Rule

During `sync`, GTM target selection is a required user-confirmation step.

- never auto-select the GTM account, container, or workspace for the user
- always show the candidate list and require explicit user confirmation at each selection step
- a matching domain name or a likely production-looking option is not enough to justify auto-selection
- only skip a selection step when the user has already provided the exact GTM ID for that step

## Important Notes

- prefer `--output-root` for `analyze`; `--output-dir` is only a deprecated exact artifact-directory override
- `analyze` supports partial mode with `--urls` for specific same-domain pages
- `analyze` also supports `--storefront-password` for password-protected Shopify dev stores
- `generate-gtm` will surface any custom dimensions that must be registered in GA4 before you continue
- `generate-gtm` now requires a current schema confirmation; use `./event-tracking confirm-schema <artifact-dir>/event-schema.json` after schema review
- selector-based events may still need review when the site uses unstable or highly dynamic markup
- Shopify validation differs from the standard automated GTM preview flow

## Maintenance

- `npm test` rebuilds the CLI and runs the standalone automated workflow-state and gate tests.
- `npm run doctor` checks Node, the built CLI artifact, the repo-local wrapper, and the Playwright Chromium install.
- `npm run export:skills` writes self-contained skill bundles to `dist/skill-bundles/` for packaging outside the repo.
- `npm run install:skills` installs the exported bundles into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`, with optional `--target-dir` and `--skill` filters.
- `npm run install:skills -- --mode link` links the exported bundles into the skills directory instead of copying them, which is useful during local iteration.
- `npm run check` rebuilds the CLI, runs automated tests, smoke-tests `./event-tracking --help`, exports and installs skill bundles into a temp directory, and enforces the public command surface in docs.

## Product Boundary

- the core workflow runs locally
- it does not require JTracking product authorization
- GTM sync is handled through Google OAuth
- generic sites are validated through GTM Preview Mode
- Shopify stores use custom pixel artifacts plus manual validation after installation

## Need A More Advanced Setup?

This skill reflects the implementation workflow behind [JTracking](https://www.jtracking.ai).

If you need a more advanced setup, JTracking also supports:

- richer event design based on business scenarios
- server-side tracking and custom loader support
- more channel connections such as GA4, Meta, Google Ads, TikTok, and Klaviyo
- longer-term, unified tracking management
