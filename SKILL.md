description: Use when you need end-to-end GA4 + GTM tracking delivery across discovery, schema, sync, and verification phases.
compatibility: >
  Requires Node.js 18+, npm, and Playwright Chromium for browser-backed steps.
  Analyze, selector validation, preview, and GTM sync must run outside sandboxed
  environments. GTM sync uses interactive Google OAuth and caches credentials in
  the artifact directory. Optional anonymous telemetry is opt-in and can be
  disabled with DO_NOT_TRACK=1 or EVENT_TRACKING_TELEMETRY=0.

# Event Tracking Skill

Use this skill as the end-to-end coordinator for GA4 + GTM tracking delivery.

Use it when:

- the user needs a full GA4 + GTM implementation flow, from analysis to go-live readiness
- the request spans multiple workflow phases (discovery, schema, sync, verification, publish)
- the correct entry point is still unclear and you need this skill to route to the right phase

Do not assume the user wants the full workflow.

## Auto-Update

This installed root skill can self-check for newer GitHub versions before you continue.

Before doing any task in this bundle:

1. Resolve the directory that contains this installed `SKILL.md`. Installer-managed copies usually live under the skills directory configured by your agent environment, such as `$CODEX_HOME/skills/event-tracking-skill` or an equivalent runtime-managed path.
2. Run `node "<bundle-dir>/runtime/skill-runtime/update-check.mjs" --json`.
3. If the result status is `update_available`, immediately run `node "<bundle-dir>/runtime/skill-runtime/self-update.mjs" --apply`.
4. If the update succeeds, read `<bundle-dir>/SKILL.md` again before continuing so you are using the refreshed instructions.
5. If the result status is `disabled`, treat this bundle as a local development link or repo checkout and continue without updating.

## Skill Family

The skill family is split into one umbrella skill plus seven phase skills:

- `tracking-discover` for crawl coverage, platform detection, and fresh artifact bootstrap
- `tracking-group` for page-group authoring and approval
- `tracking-live-gtm` for auditing the real live GTM runtime before schema generation
- `tracking-schema` for schema preparation, review, validation, and approval
- `tracking-sync` for GTM config generation and sync
- `tracking-verify` for preview QA and optional publish handoff
- `tracking-shopify` for Shopify-specific schema, sync, install, and verification rules

If the request is already bounded to one phase and that phase skill is available, route there instead of inlining the full runbook here.

Once `site-analysis.json` indicates Shopify, keep discovery and grouping shared, then let `tracking-shopify` own the Shopify-specific branch.

## Shared Contract

1. Use the repo-local wrapper `./event-tracking` for CLI commands in this repository. If the wrapper reports that `dist/cli.js` is missing, run `npm run build` first. This bundle assumes Node.js 18+, npm, and Playwright Chromium are available for browser-backed commands.
2. Keep one artifact directory per site (`<output-root>/<url-slug>`). Each iteration inside that artifact should use a distinct run ID with snapshots under `versions/<run-id>/`.
3. If the user already provides an artifact directory or one of its files, resume from the earliest unmet prerequisite instead of restarting from `analyze`.
4. Use `./event-tracking status <artifact-dir-or-file>` whenever the current checkpoint or next step is unclear.
5. Use `./event-tracking runs <output-root>` when the user wants to find recent site runs and does not remember the artifact directory.
6. Google OAuth client metadata is embedded in the CLI and may be overridden with `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
7. Any Playwright-backed or OAuth-triggering step must run outside a sandboxed environment by default. In practice, treat `analyze`, `validate-schema --check-selectors`, `preview`, and `sync` as non-sandbox commands, and do not first attempt them in the sandbox before retrying after interception.
8. Run prompt-driven OAuth / GTM selection commands with an interactive TTY from the start. In practice, run `sync` with TTY enabled unless the user already provided exact `--account-id`, `--container-id`, and `--workspace-id` values. Do not first try non-interactive sync and then retry with TTY.
9. GTM OAuth credentials are cached per artifact at `<artifact-dir>/credentials.json`; local migration code may also clear or import older credential files when the user asks to reuse or clear stored auth.
10. Anonymous usage telemetry is opt-in. It stores consent in the local user config, never sends full URLs, file paths, selectors, GTM/GA IDs, OAuth data, or raw errors, and is disabled by `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `EVENT_TRACKING_TELEMETRY=0`.
11. Never auto-select a GTM account, GTM container, or GTM workspace on the user's behalf. Always show candidates and require explicit confirmation unless the user already provided the exact ID for that step.
12. Prefer scenario-first entry commands for user-facing flows: `run-new-setup`, `run-tracking-update`, `run-upkeep`, `run-health-audit`. Use `start-scenario` when the user wants a labeled scenario run without immediate template execution.
13. Use `./event-tracking scenario <artifact-dir> --set <scenario> [--sub-scenario ...] [--new-run]` for metadata-only adjustments when you should not alter execution flow.
14. Use `./event-tracking scenario-check <artifact-dir>` when the question is "is this scenario ready" rather than "what is the next workflow checkpoint".
15. Use `./event-tracking scenario-transition <artifact-dir> --to <scenario> [--reason ...]` when the user wants an auditable handoff between scenarios.
16. Do not continue past the phase boundary the user asked for. Stop after the requested phase unless the user explicitly asks to continue.

## Conversation Intake

When the user enters through chat and has not yet provided a bounded phase, artifact directory, or exact command, start with an intent-first intake.

Classify the request into one of these entry intents:

- `resume_existing_run`: the user already has an artifact directory or one of its files; inspect the artifacts and use `status`
- `new_setup`: net-new tracking implementation from scratch; prefer `run-new-setup`, then follow its recommended next step
- `tracking_update`: revise or extend an existing implementation; prefer `run-tracking-update`
- `upkeep`: routine maintenance, review, or incremental QA on an existing setup; prefer `run-upkeep`
- `tracking_health_audit`: audit-only assessment of current live tracking; prefer `run-health-audit`
- `analysis_only`: crawl/bootstrap/discovery only without committing to the full workflow yet; route to `tracking-discover` and stop after `analyze`

Rules:

- Do not ask the user to choose between `scenario` and `analyze`. `scenario` is run-intent orchestration metadata; `analyze` is only one execution step.
- If intent is ambiguous, ask one short plain-language intake question using user-facing terms such as "new setup", "update existing tracking", "upkeep", "health audit", "analyze only", or "resume an existing run".
- If the user gives a fresh URL and asks to set up tracking, default to `new_setup`.
- If the user gives a fresh URL and only asks to inspect the site, analyze structure, or review current tracking signals, default to `analysis_only`.
- If the user gives an artifact directory or workflow file, default to `resume_existing_run` instead of restarting from `analyze`.

## Routing Rules

Route by user intent and current artifacts:

- fresh URL, crawl request, or no artifacts yet: start with `tracking-discover`
- `site-analysis.json` with missing or unconfirmed `pageGroups`: route to `tracking-group`
- confirmed `site-analysis.json` with detected live GTM container IDs but no live baseline review yet: route to `tracking-live-gtm`
- confirmed `site-analysis.json` or an in-progress `event-schema.json`: route to `tracking-schema`
- `gtm-config.json`: route to `tracking-sync`
- `gtm-context.json`: route to `tracking-verify`, with publish treated as a separate explicit action
- Shopify platform confirmation: keep shared early stages, then hand off to `tracking-shopify`

If only the root skill is available, follow the same routing logic directly and stop at the matching phase boundary.

## Stop Rules

- Do not bypass page-group approval before `prepare-schema`.
- For key decision checkpoints, always require explicit user confirmation before continuing:
  - `pageGroups` (before `confirm-page-groups` and before `prepare-schema`)
  - `event-schema.json` (before `confirm-schema` and before `generate-gtm`)
  - GTM target selection (account/container/workspace during `sync`)
  - publish decision (before `publish`)
- If confirmation is missing or ambiguous, stop and ask; do not auto-proceed.
- When live GTM containers are detected on the site, do not bypass the live baseline review before schema generation.
- Do not bypass schema approval before `generate-gtm` unless the user explicitly wants `--force`.
- Treat preview QA and publish as separate decisions.
- Treat `tracking-health.json` as the publish gate; do not jump to publish when health is missing, manual-only, or blocked unless the user explicitly wants `--force`.
- Treat Shopify manual verification as the expected path for Shopify runs, not as a fallback error case.
- Treat `tracking_health_audit` as an audit-only scenario. Do not run GTM deployment actions (`generate-gtm`, `sync`, `publish`) unless the user explicitly asks to override.

## Resume And Closeout

When resuming:

- prefer `workflow-state.json` when present
- still inspect the real artifact set if warnings indicate stale gates
- use `status` when the next step is unclear

When a phase or the full workflow ends, summarize:

- first give a compact, decision-ready summary in plain language
- keep the default chat summary human-readable; do not dump raw JSON, raw URL lists, or artifact inventory first
- for page grouping, summarize group count, grouping logic, and a compact group table before any file references
- for schema review, default to `Event Table`, then `Common Properties`, then `Event-specific Properties`
- keep `tracking_health_audit` and `upkeep` as separate summary modes even if they share rendering helpers
- only after the summary, list artifact directory, current checkpoint, key output files, next recommended command, and remaining manual actions
