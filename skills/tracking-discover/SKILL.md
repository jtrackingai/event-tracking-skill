# Tracking Discover

Use this skill for analysis-only work and fresh workflow bootstrap.

## Inputs

- target URL
- output root directory
- optional Shopify storefront password

## Commands

In this repository, use the repo-root wrapper:

```bash
./event-tracking analyze <url> --output-root <output-root>
```

Run `analyze` outside sandboxed environments by default. Do not first attempt the Playwright crawl inside the sandbox and then retry after it is intercepted.

Partial mode:

```bash
./event-tracking analyze <url> --output-root <output-root> --urls https://example.com/page-a,https://example.com/page-b
```

## Required Output

Produce and share:

- `<artifact-dir>/site-analysis.json`
- `<artifact-dir>/workflow-state.json`

Report:

- pages analyzed
- skipped URLs
- warnings
- detected `dataLayer` events
- detected live GTM container IDs
- detected platform

## Stop Boundary

Unless the user explicitly asks for the next phase, stop after analysis.

If the user wants to continue, the default next command is:

```bash
./event-tracking status <artifact-dir>
```
